USER INSTRUCTIONS: App02 TicketMachine
Description:

This app is a simple simulation of a ticket machine where the user enter real money and is able to purchase a ticket

Requirements
Edit your copy of App02-ticketmachine as a starting point and make it more realistic by offering tickets to three local stations

Aylesbury costing £2.20
Amersham costing £3.00
High Wycombe costing £3.30
Features
Each ticket should have a destination, a cost and the date purchased.
Print all available Tickets
Select one of the Tickets to buy
Add methods to the TicketMachine so that a user can insert 10p, 20, £1.00 and £2.00 coins.
After each coin is inserted the machine should display the amount entered and the current balance.
Required Testing
Create a TicketMachine and use it to purchase all three tickets. Make sure that your tests include trying to purchase a ticket with too little money inserted, and also with too much money inserted. Show that excess money can be refunded. Use the terminal window to record your tests.
